Notes on teams
==============

* "TEAM POCOMOTION (VIKINGS)" appears to have stopped accumulating official points at race 2, though they stopped participating entirely from race 5.
* "TEAM BTR" seem to have lost 35 points in Race 3 as Stuart Hardy wasn't counted.
* "TEAM BTR" picked up another 24 absent points in Race 4. This would be consistent with "Tom Moss" riding for BTR (instead of SDW Bees) and Stuart being not counted, which seems odd.
* "TEAM BTR" found 10 points in race 5 that I can't explain, though it's again consistent with the "Tom Moss" theory.
* "MOON RIDERS" seem to have used "Ross Collins" as a substitution for "Tomasz Poniatowski" starting in race 4.
* "PEDALERS" seem to have used "Christophe Contant" as a substitution for "Jurgen Janssens" starting from race 2.
* "RASIO RACING" seem to have used "Jan Deca" as a substitution for "JÃ¸rgen Vanbers" starting from race 5.
